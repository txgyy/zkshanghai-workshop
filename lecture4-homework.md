# 第4课 课后作业

* [x] Check out https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/ and set up a starter project!

安装步骤很简单，按照官方文档[quick-setup](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/docs/quick-setup)进行。

运行my-app中的测试合约：
```shell
jinjin@Mac-mini contracts % npm test

> monorepo-ethers-contracts@1.0.0 test
> hardhat run scripts/download-snark-artifacts.ts && hardhat test



  Feedback
    # joinGroup
      ✔ Should allow users to join the group (618ms)
    # sendFeedback
      ✔ Should allow users to send feedback anonymously (2138ms)


  2 passing (5s)
  ```

生成Generate a test coverage report:
```shell
jinjin@Mac-mini contracts % npm run test:coverage

> monorepo-ethers-contracts@1.0.0 test:coverage
> hardhat coverage


Version
=======
> solidity-coverage: v0.7.22

Instrumenting for coverage...
=============================

> Feedback.sol

Compilation:
============

Generating typings for: 12 artifacts in dir: ./build/typechain for target: ethers-v5
Successfully generated 40 typings!
Compiled 14 Solidity files successfully

Network Info
============
> HardhatEVM: v2.14.0
> network:    hardhat



  Feedback
    # joinGroup
      ✔ Should allow users to join the group (731ms)
    # sendFeedback
      ✔ Should allow users to send feedback anonymously (2396ms)
